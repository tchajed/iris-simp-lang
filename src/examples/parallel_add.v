===============
Using adequacy
===============

We proved an Iris specification, but what does it really mean about the program?
We can use the simp_lang adequacy theorem to "extract" the pure postcondition
into a statement about the execution semantics.

The Iris triple says two things, which are bundled into the `adequate`
definition used by `simp_adequacy`: `parallel_add` will not get stuck, and if it
terminates in a value (with some additional forked threads [es]), that value
will be 4. We'll only prove the second part here.

To use adequacy and this triple, we'll finally gather up all the functors needed
for Iris ghost state and produce one of the Σ assumptions used in all of our
proofs; it has all the ghost state needed for the features used in this proof.

Note that we aren't in a section and this theorem statement only refers to the
language semantics, so we've eliminated Iris from our trusted computing base!
The theorem refers to the semantics through erased_step, which ignores
observations; this doesn't matter for this language because we aren't using
prophecy variables.
