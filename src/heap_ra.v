Heap CMRA
==========

Here we define the CMRA we'll use to construct the "points-to" ghost state
that will be built-in to the program logic, in the sense that its meaning is
tied to the physical state of the program by the program logic definition itself.

Ordinarily you wouldn't build a CMRA "by hand" like this, but instead would use
the various combinators provided by Iris. In fact, there's a library called
gen_heap built on top of the auth RA (and a few others) that works well for the
purpose in simp_lang. However, by building it up ourselves it's easier to show
how all the pieces fit together and reduce the amount of magic.

The downside to constructing the RA by hand is that this file has a subsantial
amount of proof.

This library is parameterized over arbitrary types of keys (`K`) and values
(`V`), although we will only use it for `loc` and `val` of simp_lang.
Mathematically, we can think of this RA as having elements of the form `Auth m`
and `Frag m` where `m : gmap K V`, which stand for "authorative ownership" and
"fragmentary ownership". The idea is that there is a single `Auth σ` that holds
the true, physical heap, while `Frag m` will be owned by threads and gives the
right to read/modify a part of the heap. We'll also have a special `⊥` (invalid)
element to represent compositions that don't make sense.

These have the following composition/validity properties:

- `Auth m ⋅ Auth m' = ⊥` (there's only one auth)
- `Frag m ⋅ Frag m' = m ∪ m' if m and m' are disjoint (##ₘ)
- `✓ (Auth m ⋅ Frag m') ↔ m' ⊆ m (fragments always agree with the authoritative copy)

An important special case is `Frag {[k := v]}`, fragmentary ownership of a
singleton. This is like a points-to fact, and in fact `l ↦ v` will be *defined* as
`own (Frag {[l := v]})`.

This CMRA permits the following important *local updates* and validity rules, which are
"frame-preserving updates". `x ~~> y` is defined to be `∀ z, ✓ (x ⋅ z) → ✓ (y ⋅
z)`, which means that we can replace x with y locally and preserve global
validity.

- `Auth m ~~> Auth (<[k := v]> m) ⋅ Frag {[k := v]` if `m !! k = None`
- `Auth m ⋅ Frag {[k := v]} ~~> Auth (<[k := v']> m) ⋅ Frag {[k := v']}`

  (** The carrier for the CMRA we're defining. We will define something that
  looks like a PCM (partial commutative monoid), with a partial composition
  operation that returns `Invalid` when composition doesn't make sense. We need
  to do this to fit into Iris's algebraic structure for resource, called a CMRA,
  which isntead has a notion of composing elements and a predicate for valid
  elements.  The difference is important for higher-order ghost state, but this
  is not a higher-order CMRA (that is, it doesn't depend on `iProp`). *)

  (** In a PCM there would be a unit for composition ε and `∀ x, x ⋅ ε = x`.
  Instead of a global unit, a CMRA requires one more piece: a partial core or
  `pcore`, that (might) give a unit for each element - the might is the
  "partial" in the name. The `pcore` is used to model the persistently modality
  (□P). It won't be relevant to our example, but this CMRA has a unit and we can
  use it to give a total pcore, which turns out to simplify some proofs later.
